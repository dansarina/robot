To compile, just ``make.'' Before you run dansarina, make sure you tell
her where to go, which name to use, which ports, and which channel to
join, et cetera. For example, to set the IRC server, just say

                     echo irc.dal.net > ctl/rsserv

and notice that rsserv means ``remote server.'' The file myport is a
local port which dansarina will listen for telnet connections; you can
control her through this connection --- as you can through a DCC CHAT,
but make sure she is not behind a firewall for a DCC CHAT.

Before you try to telnet or DCC CHAT to her, log her in the IRC server
and say hello to her with 

                          /msg dansarina hello

where dansarina is her nickname; if you call her britney, then write
britney. After saying hello, set a password with

                       /msg dansarina pass mumble

where mumble is your password. The first user who says hello becomes her
master.

The programs in run/ are plugins. They are called by saying @filename in
a channel where dansarina is in. To get her in other channels, make a
DCC CHAT to her, and say

                           .raw JOIN #channel

and in this fashion, she can perform any IRC command such as 

                           .raw NICK britney

and 

              .raw PRIVMSG nickserv :identify dropdeadfred

et cetera.
