Writing plugins to dansarina is very easy; just place an executable in
run/ that does what you want. All plugins receive at least 4 parameters
in the command line which are

                   nickname username hostname channel

so a shell script would get this information by using the variables $1,
$2, $3 e $4. Any extra arguments come in $5, et cetera. That's all the
input a plugin takes. 

Whatever the plugin prints to the standard out goes to the IRC
server. So, a shell script which would say something to a user could do
it as

                      echo PRIVMSG '#'$4 :$1, hi.

Notice that $4 is the channel name, and $1 is the nickname. Plugins
therefore can send any messages to the IRC server, so they can reach
users privately, et cetera.
